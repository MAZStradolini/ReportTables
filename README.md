# ReportTables

This script is used to locate all .xlsx files in a selectable folder and, using the Dictionary.py file, it finds services within the tables and returns a new table (consolidated.xlsx) with information such as the name of the source file, the name of the found service, quantities, and total values. The consolidated table can be used for analysis with PowerBI.
